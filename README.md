Dynamo Charlotte is a Python-based Interpreter that runs on Python Lex-Yacc Parser. It is a beginner friendly language with a syntax similar to Visual Basic and Python, allowing to create anything from numbers to multi-dimensional arrays. The goal of Dynamo Charlotte is to keep a simple coding syntax while still referring to fundamental aspects of programming such as Non-Dynammic Memory, Explicit Data Types and much more. An ideal First-Time Language for teaching kids and programming beginners who are interested in coding, allowing them to learn and dive into the amazing world of Software Engineering üë©‚Äçüíªüë®‚Äçüíª.

How to Run Dynamo Charlotte
==========

*Requirements: 
- For running on Windows Desktop: Dynamo Charlotte IDE v2.0 - [Click Here to Download](https://github.com/jc-juarez/dynamocharlotte_ide/raw/main/Dynamo%20Charlotte%20IDE%20v2.0.exe) or visit [Dynamo Charlotte IDE Repository.](https://github.com/jc-juarez/dynamocharlotte_ide)
- For running on Python: Python 3.6+ installed.

### Running Dynamo Charlotte on Dynamo Charlotte IDE (Windows)

Simply download Dynamo Charlotte IDE and you can start writing code in Dynamo Charlotte instantly! 

**Important:** If you run Dynamo Charlotte on the IDE **ommit** the **'import dynamo charlotte as dc'** and **'dc.run()'** commands, as those are for Python. Write your code directly into the editor as if it were inside the **'dc.run()'** function.

### Running Dynamo Charlotte on Python


- **It is recommended to use the Dynamo Charlotte Compiler instead: https://github.com/jc-juarez/dynamocharlotte_compiler**
- The Compiler allows for a simpler execution from your terminal.


Make sure you have Python 3.6+ installed and run the following command on your terminal:

```python
pip install dynamocharlotte
```

Now Create a Python File and Import Dynamo Charlotte as follows:

```python
import dynamocharlotte as dc
```

Now call the 'run' function on 'dc' in order to execute Dynamo Charlotte. To do this simply pass the code as a parameter using Python Multi-line String Triple Quotes. All Dynamo Charlotte Programs include a 'Main<>' and 'End<>' keyword, where 'Main<>' defines the start of the Main program and 'End<>' the end of the Program. The base template looks as follows:

```python
dc.run('''

  Main<>

  End<>

''')
```

Now you are ready to go. Here's a 'Hello World!' Program Example. Just run it in your favorite IDE:

```python
import dynamocharlotte as dc

dc.run('''

  Main<>

    print("Hello World!")

  End<>

''')
```

For more Example Programs please check [Dynamo Charlotte Code Examples.](https://github.com/JC-Juarez/dynamocharlotte/tree/main/Code%20Examples)

Dynamo Charlotte Documentation - Syntax, Grammar and Considerations
==========

Things to consider:

* While no Indentation is required for Dynamo Charlotte, it is strongly recommended for a better visualization.
* Operators priority is the same as in most Traditional Programming Languages (Visual Basic, C++, Python, Java, etc.)
* There are two types of Variables: Traditional (Number and String) and Object (Vector, Matrix and Cube).
* Object Variables are heterogeneous.
* Variables cannot start with numbers and cannot be the same as reserved tokens.
* The 'camelCase' variable declaration model is the official model for Dynamo Charlotte.

## Main Section

The Main section of the code starts with the word **'Main<>'** and ends with the word **'End<>'**:

```python
import dynamocharlotte as dc

dc.run('''

Main<>

...

End<>

''')
```

## Comments

Comments can be added by writing **'//'** followed the comment content. The can be placed at any part of the program:

```python
import dynamocharlotte as dc

dc.run('''

// This is a comment

Main<>

// Another comment

...

// One more comment

End<>

// The last comment

''')
```

## Traditional Variables Declaration and Assignment

There are two types of Traditional Variables: **'number'** and **'string'**. The type **'number'** can only hold numerical values such as:

```
3
3.2
0.15
99
```

The type **'string'** holds text values, cannot operate with arithmetical operators, and is declared and expressed by using double quotes in order to tell it apart from the type **'number'**:

```
"Hello World!"
"Red Car"
"3"
"The square root of 8 is 2.82..."
```

It is important to know that all variables must be declared at the top beginning of the program, before anything else (excluding comments, which can be at any part of the code). They are declared by using the word **'var'** followed by the name we want the variable to have, and then we use the word **'as'** followed by the Variable type, which can be either a **'number'** or **'string'**:

```python
import dynamocharlotte as dc

dc.run('''

var myNumber as number

var myString as string

Main<>

...

End<>

''')
```

Now, to assign a value to a Traditional Variable, it is only needed to indicate the name of the variable followed by **'='** and the expression that will correspond to it. It is important to realize that due the fact that Variables in Dynamo Charlotee are explicitely typed, they can only be assigned an expression of their same type:

```python
import dynamocharlotte as dc

dc.run('''

var myNumber as number

var myString as string

Main<>

...

myNumber = 3

myString = "Hello Dynamo Charlotte!"

...

End<>

''')
```

## Object Variables Declaration, Assignment and Access

There are three types of Object Variables: **'vector'**, **'matrix'** and **'cube'**. All these three types work in a similar way to C++ Non-Dynammic Arrays, with the difference that all three are heterogeneous, which means that they can contain both Tradtional Variables of type **'number'** or **'string'** inside them. Just as Traditional Variables, Object Variables must be declared at the very top as well by first indicating their type followed by their sizes inside parentheses, each with their number of parameters corresponding to their dimensions, and finally followed by the name we want the variable to have:

```python
import dynamocharlotte as dc

dc.run('''

vector(3) myVector

matrix(3,4) myMatrix

cube(3,4,5) myCube

Main<>

...

End<>

''')
```

In order to access them at their exact positions, we can use their indices by using **'[index]'**. As this is not a declaration but rather an expression, this must be inside the Main Section. Their assignment follows the same model; we use their indices and assign an expression in the same way as Traditional Variables:

```python
import dynamocharlotte as dc

dc.run('''

var i as number

var j as number

var k as number

vector(3) myVector

matrix(3,4) myMatrix

cube(3,4,5) myCube

Main<>

...

myVector[0] = 1

myMatrix[0][1] = 2

myCube[0][1][2] = 3

i = myVector[0]

j = myMatrix[0][1]

k = myCube[0][1][2]

...

End<>

''')
```
